Admin
-----
Make migration before loggin in the admin panel for the first time.


Models
------
DateTimeField
-------------
Suppose in a Post model we have a field named date_posted.
if we use, date_posted = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True),
it will take the current time and will get updated when we update the post.

if we use, date_posted = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True),
it will take the current time but date can never be changed.

Best option:
from django.utils import timezone

class Post(models.Model):
    date_posted = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)

# Notice, use didn't use parenthesis after timezone.now.
By this we are not executing timezone.now function at this point,
instead, we are just passing the funtion as default value.


Routing
-------
In urls.py, we use a trailing slash after every route in the urlpatters, to avoid confusion.
urlpatterns = [
    path('about/', views.about, name='blog-about'),
]


Template Inheritance
--------------------
In file.html during template inheritance, end a block by {% endblock block_name %} to avoid confusion.
You can also use just {% endblock %}, but mentioning the name will help while ending multiple blocks.
