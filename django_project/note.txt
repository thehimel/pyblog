Routing
-------
In urls.py, we use a trailing slash after every route in the urlpatters, to avoid confusion.
urlpatterns = [
    path('about/', views.about, name='blog-about'),
]

Template Inheritance
--------------------
In file.html during template inheritance, end a block by {% endblock block_name %} to avoid confusion.
You can also use just {% endblock %}, but mentioning the name will help while ending multiple blocks.
